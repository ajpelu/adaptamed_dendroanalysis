# Data Sources

## Satellite data 

### Vegetation Indexes 

- We extracted temporal series of vegetation indexes as a surrogate of productivity. 

- We used the MODIS product MOD13Q1 (temporal resolution: 16 days; spatial resolution = 250 m). We used NDVI and EVI spectral index. 

- For each field plot, we extracted all the composite images of the MODIS product (using the centroid of the field plot). Then, a temporal series was created for each field plot. 

### Annual Net Primary Productivity 

- We extracted temporal series of yearly NPP from MODIS product MOD17A3HGF (temporal resolution: yearly; spatial resolution = 500 m). See [here](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mod17a3hgfv006/) for a description of the method to obtain the NPP.
