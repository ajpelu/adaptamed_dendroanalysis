# Data Sources

## Satellite data 

- We extracted temporal series of vegetation indexes as a surrogate of productivity. 

- We used the MODIS product MOD13Q1 (temporal resolution: ; spatial resolution = 250 m). We used NDVI and EVI spectral index. 

- For each field plot, we extracted all the composite images of the MODIS product (using the centroid of the field plot). Then, a temporal series was created for each field plot.
